# Node PSU Obfuscator

This is a symple node-js application that, using the PSU api, will obfuscate you lua scripts.

## Usage

First we will need to obtain a obfuscation key on the site [PSU site](https://psu.dev/api/)

Just paste all your files (and folders if you want) inside the input folder, and wait for the PSU obfuscator to do it's job.

When done, the application will create the same pattern of folders and files inside the output folder.

To run the application just run the command

```node
node main.js
```

and the magic will begin!

Enjoy :)
